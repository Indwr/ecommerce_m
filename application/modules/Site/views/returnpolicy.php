We only ask that you don't use the product and preserve its original condition, tags, and packaging. You are welcome to try on a product but please take adequate measure to preserve its condition. There are two ways to return the product to us:</p>
                                        <ul style="list-style: disc;padding-left: 30px;">

                                        	<li>Self-Ship: If we don't offer a pick up at your location. In such cases, we will credit the shipping costs in the form of Arisestarworld credits provided the product meets the return policy and you have shared scan copy of the courier receipt with us.</li>
